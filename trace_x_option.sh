#The output is a verbose trace of the scriptâ€™s execution. Note that the lines 
#without the plus sign are the output of the script that would be displayed if
# the script were run without tracing enabled. As you can see, this type of 
#trace is highly useful in determining the value that variables contain during
# the execution of a script, as well as the route that the code
#took based on the conditions satisfied.
